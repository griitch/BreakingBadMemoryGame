# Breaking Bad memory game

## Game Rules :
You are presented with multiple images of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul characters. The images get shuffled every-time they are clicked. You CAN NOT click on any image more than once or else your score resets to zero. The main objective is to get the highest score as possible.
